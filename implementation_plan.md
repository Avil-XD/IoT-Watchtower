# IoT Security Implementation Plan

## Current Implementation Status
1. ✓ IoT Network Simulation
2. ✓ Attack Simulation (Botnet)
3. ✓ Event Collection & Storage
4. ✓ Monitoring Dashboard

## Machine Learning Component Plan

### 1. Data Collection (src/ml/collect_training_data.py)
- Generate normal network traffic data
- Simulate different types of attacks:
  * Botnet attacks
  * DDoS attempts
  * Unauthorized access
- Label data with attack types
- Store in structured format for training

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Extract relevant features:
  * Network traffic patterns (packet size, frequency)
  * Device behavior metrics (state changes, commands)
  * Time-based features (time of day, intervals)
- Normalize/scale features
- Create training/validation splits

### 3. Model Implementation (src/ml/attack_classifier.py)
- Use sklearn for initial implementation
- Implement RandomForest classifier
- Support for multiple attack types:
  * Botnet detection
  * Anomaly detection
  * Behavior classification
- Include confidence scores

### 4. Training Pipeline (src/ml/train_model.py)
- Load and preprocess data
- Train model with cross-validation
- Save trained model and metadata
- Generate performance metrics:
  * Accuracy
  * Precision/Recall
  * F1 Score
  * Confusion Matrix

### 5. Real-time Classification (src/ml/attack_detector.py)
- Load trained model
- Process incoming events in real-time
- Classify attack types
- Calculate confidence scores
- Integrate with monitoring dashboard

### 6. Integration
- Connect ML predictions to event collector
- Update monitoring dashboard with ML features:
  * Attack type distribution
  * Classification confidence
  * Model performance metrics

## Timeline
1. Data Collection & Feature Engineering: 2-3 days
2. Model Implementation & Training: 2-3 days
3. Real-time Classification: 1-2 days
4. Integration & Testing: 2-3 days

## Next Steps
1. Implement data collection script
2. Build feature extraction pipeline
3. Train initial model
4. Integrate with existing monitoring system
